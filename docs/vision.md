# 🌱 AgriProof – Project Vision

AgriProof is an onchain protocol that captures and rewards real-world agricultural activities by tokenizing them into verifiable digital records. This project bridges traditional farming with Web3, empowering farmers to turn their daily efforts into traceable, valuable onchain actions.

## 🌾 Phase 1: Agriculture

- Focus on crop and livestock farming.
- Farmers submit data about their farming activities (planting, harvesting, feeding, irrigation).
- Data can be submitted daily, weekly, or monthly through a simple mobile interface.
- AI evaluates the data based on consistency, accuracy, and effort.
- Points are awarded → converted into onchain tokens → farmers earn rewards.

## 🎯 The Broader Vision

This is just the beginning. AgriProof is designed to become a foundation for **tokenizing real-world human activity**. Future expansions may include:

- Health and fitness
- Education
- Community service
- Manual labor
- Daily environmental contributions

Our goal is to make **“Proof-of-Life Activity”** a standard for earning value in Web3.

## 🧱 Built On

- Blockchain (Polygon / Celo / Gnosis)
- Smart Contracts for reward distribution
- AI for evaluating activity data
- Mobile-first tools for farmers

## 🤝 Call to Action

We are currently in the early design and vision testing phase. Developers, designers, researchers, and farmers are welcome to join us on this mission to **turn real-life effort into onchain value.**
