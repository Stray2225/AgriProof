# ðŸŒ¾ AgriProof

AgriProof is a blockchain-powered platform that turns real-world agricultural activities into tokenized rewards. By collecting data from farmers and analyzing it with AI, we make it possible to bring daily human effortâ€”starting with farmingâ€”onchain.

## ðŸšœ Phase 1: Agriculture

Farmers can submit records of their farming activities (like planting, irrigation, or livestock care). These are evaluated by an AI model. Based on that, users earn points, which are tokenized into onchain rewards.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Goal

To bridge real life and blockchain â€” starting with agriculture. Eventually, we aim to support other sectors like education, health, labor, and more.

## ðŸ›  How It Works (Concept)

- ðŸ“¥ Farmers submit activity data (daily, weekly, monthly)
- ðŸ¤– AI evaluates the value and consistency of data
- ðŸª™ Points are awarded and tokenized
- ðŸ’° Tokens can be redeemed or used in future ecosystem features

## ðŸ’¡ Status

AgriProof is in its early stage â€” documentation, testing, and vision development are ongoing.
